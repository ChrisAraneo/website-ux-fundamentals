# Learn more about design critique sessions

A design critique session is a planned period where UX designers present their work to team members and listen to feedback. Critiques are a great opportunity to practice giving and receiving feedback to and from fellow team members. During a critique, your team gathers to explore new ideas and possible directions for a design. These sessions are planned ahead of time with an agenda and set objectives, so you'll have time to prepare and bring fresh ideas to the table. Gathering together, whether in person or virtually, builds rapport and encourages collaboration across teams.

## Design critique roles

A design critique session is made up of three main groups of participants: facilitator, presenter, and reviewer. Let's explore each role in detail.

### Facilitator

The facilitator of a design critique is in charge of running the critique session and guiding the feedback process. They may keep track of the time and create the agenda and goals for the meeting. The facilitator is also responsible for ensuring everyone in the meeting is included and gets to share their ideas. Whether it's because of a personality trait of an individual or a bias of the group, some people are going to be left out of the process if they're not directly engaged. The facilitator makes sure each person gets an opportunity to share. Not all design critiques include a facilitator, but in many cases, especially when working with a large team, one can be very helpful.

### Presenter

The presenter is the designer sharing their work with the team throughout the session. This could also be a group of designers who worked together. They might share their designs directly from Figma or Adobe XD through screen share, or they might create a presentation in Google Slides or Microsoft PowerPoint with images of their designs. As a designer, you'll often take on the role of presenter. Make sure you engage with others in the meeting and prepare to ask questions and offer feedback.

### Reviewers

The reviewers offer feedback on the designs presented and what steps are needed to improve the designs. There are often multiple reviewers and multiple critique sessions to look at the design from different perspectives.

### Notetaker

Additionally, there may be a fourth role of notetaker, who documents the ideas and keeps track of all the feedback so the conversations can flow without interruption. The notetaker will likely record notes in a digital document so the notes can be shared with the entire group later.

Together, all of these roles work to create effective solutions to strengthen your designs. Throughout your UX design career, you'll get the chance to facilitate, present, and review in a critique session.

## The design critique process

Design critiques can take many forms, depending on the work being reviewed and the number of participating members. Because there's no one right way to conduct a critique, it's important to prepare and plan the session ahead of time.

Typically, the design critique follows this flow:

1. **Facilitator opens the session** - goes over the meeting's objectives and goals, which should be clear and time-specific (for example, "We need to update all the current mocks before next week").

2. **Presenter shares their designs** - reviewers start to prepare their feedback and gather any ideas or questions. Reviewers should jot down both what they like and what they'd like improved in the designs.

3. **Reviewers explain their feedback** - take time to provide detailed feedback while the presenter clarifies and guides everyone through their process for the designs.

4. **Facilitator closes the session** - addresses any lingering questions or topics not covered in the session.

## Best practices for a critique session

When it comes to presenting in design critique sessions, preparation is key. This is your chance to showcase your work to your peers. Make sure you can tell the story of your designs. You'll want to guide reviewers through your thinking behind the designs and explain how they align with the product's goals.

### Five key questions to prepare

To help you prepare for presenting your designs, focus on answering these five questions:

1. **Who are you designing for?** - identify your target users and their specific needs.

2. **What problem are you trying to solve?** - clearly articulate the user problem your design addresses.

3. **How are your designs solving or not solving those problems?** - explain your design decisions and their intended impact.

4. **Where in the design process are you?** - provide context about your current stage (early exploration, iteration, or near-final work).

5. **What aspects of your designs are you seeking feedback on?** - help reviewers focus on specific areas where you need input.

These questions help you boil down the core aspects of the designs so you can explain them better. Preparing answers will also help reviewers provide you with better feedback.

### Managing session time

Be mindful of the length of the session. You'll need enough time to not just present but discuss your ideas with reviewers and allow for follow-up questions. One way to optimize this process is by sharing your designs with everyone before the session so that they can arrive ready to discuss their feedback with you.

## Receiving feedback

Processing feedback on the spot can be overwhelming, so don't hesitate to ask reviewers to clarify their thoughts. You can also take time after the session to plan how you'll apply the feedback you received during the session.

### How to receive feedback effectively

To make the most of feedback during critique sessions:

- **Actively listen to every comment** - don't interrupt reviewers or offer explanations unless asked to do so. Instead, focus on asking questions about their feedback to grasp their perspectives.

- **Use a notetaker for longer sessions** - plan to have someone capture all of the feedback, especially if you know it will be a longer session. Knowing you'll have notes to review later will allow you to focus on the discussion.

- **Review notes before refining designs** - once you're ready to refine your designs based on the session's feedback, review any notes and pointers so you don't miss any of them.

- **Make thoughtful decisions about feedback** - you are in charge of your designs, so you don't have to incorporate every suggestion you receive. Just be prepared to explain your choices once you share your designs with your team again. Consider whether you're rejecting others' feedback because you're attached to the current version of the design or because your idea is actually a better fit for the user.

## The value of a critique session

Critique sessions are a great way to sharpen your design skills and build relationships with your teammates. As a beginning designer, you'll get the chance to become more comfortable with the process and broaden your perspective when it's time to solve design problems.

### What is a critique session?

A critique session is basically just you presenting your work to peers for feedback. Think about when you go shopping and you want to show off an outfit to friends if you're considering buying it or not. They may have some feedback like "No, that doesn't really look that good," or "Oh yeah, that looks really good on you." It's just that same idea but with your design work instead. You're presenting it, explaining what you like about it, what you don't like about it, what you might have questions on, and then getting feedback from your peers about what they think and what is or isn't working.

### Why critiques are important

Critiques are important because they give you a chance to really improve upon the work. It's easy to get lost in the specific assignment you've been given and maybe lose focus on what goals you're trying to reach, and maybe how your work fits into a broader journey. Whether you're working on a feature that's part of a larger product, or you're not considering what the rest of the users' day or task might look like, other people coming in can help bring that fresh perspective to you and make sure you're not getting too stuck in the details of your own work.

### No distinction between entry-level and senior

In a critique session there's not really a distinction between being entry-level or senior. At some point everyone is going to have work that they want to put in front of their peers for feedback, so you're going to be expected to play the same roles as a presenter or as a reviewer. Just be thoughtful about how you're presenting and how you're giving feedback.

### Tips for presenting

As a presenter, one of the hardest things to do in a critique is keep people focused on the specific things you want feedback on. Oftentimes, people will want to start reviewing other parts of the designs or other parts of the product. It's easy for discussions to go off the rails. As much as possible, try to keep the discussion focused on the task at hand.

### Tips for reviewing

When reviewing someone else's work, before giving feedback, always make sure you have a way to connect it to some broader point. Provide the right framing for your feedback, so you're not leaving someone with just your subjective opinion. Even if you have a subjective opinion, attach it to something that they can find useful to anchor to.

### Growth through critiques

When you're talking about what makes the work better, part of what you're doing is also talking about what can make you better as a designer. You can learn from the types of feedback you're receiving about things to maybe improve upon in the future, things you can start looking for on your own. All those details that came up in a critique session can be internalized and thought about how to apply to your own process. Crits have been a big part of how designers grow in their careers.

## Introduction to a mock crit session

A standard design critique session is at least 30 minutes, and the designer usually spends five to ten of those minutes presenting. Keep in mind, the session length will depend on the amount of feedback requested and the number of reviewers involved.

### What to observe in a critique session

When watching a critique session, pay attention to how the presenter responds to feedback:

- **Is the presenter actively listening?** - observe whether they're engaged and focused on understanding the feedback.

- **Is the presenter taking notes?** - notice if they're capturing important points for later review.

- **What types of follow-up questions is the presenter asking?** - look at how they seek clarification and deeper understanding.

Also focus on the way that reviewers share their feedback and opinions:

- **Do the reviewers share the reasoning behind their feedback?** - check if they explain why something works or doesn't work.

- **Do the reviewers focus on problems with the design instead of offering solutions?** - see if they describe issues and let the designer come up with solutions.

- **Do the reviewers connect their feedback to the objectives of the design critique session?** - observe whether feedback stays aligned with the session goals.

### Example critique focus areas

In a typical critique session for a design project like a dog walker app, the presenter might ask for feedback on specific elements such as the scheduling flow and call-to-action buttons. Remember, call-to-action buttons are elements in the design that tell the user to take action. In the dog walker app, the call-to-action buttons might be labeled things like "book appointment" and "next."
