## Library homepage wireframe

This section covers creating an example wireframe for a library homepage.

## Header area (top of page)

1. **Logo** (upper left corner)
   - Add rectangle with word "logo"
   - Makes purpose clear to yourself and reviewers
2. **Navigation links** (next to logo)
   - Search
   - Discover
   - Donate
   - About pages
   - Important hyperlinks for specific website type
3. **Account & cart icons** (right side of header)
   - Common design pattern in left-to-right reading languages
   - Cart link typically furthest to the right
4. **Hero Image** (below header)
   - Takes up majority of header area (but not all)
   - Include text next to image to explain content
   - Could feature author or new book release
   - Draw X in boxes to indicate image placeholder

## Above the fold

In the "above the fold" area of the library homepage website wireframe:
- Add rectangles with X inside (image placeholders)
- Add lines for corresponding descriptions
- Show latest books
- Ensure users immediately notice content when landing on homepage

## Below the fold

Include additional content for variety:
- Create new section for more books
- List six books in two groups of three rectangles
- Add lines below each for:
  - Book title
  - Author name
  - Other relevant information

## Footer area

Typical footer content:
- Organization's social media pages
- Terms and conditions
- Career opportunities
- Privacy policy
- Other useful navigation links

Design approach:
- Add lines to indicate hyperlinks
- Include full version of logo with library name
- Use smaller logo version in header to save space

## Multiple homepage wireframe options

Best practice is to create around 5 versions of important pages like homepage.

**Option A:**
- Large hero image with text next to it
- Could introduce author or featured book collection

**Option B:**
- Really prominent search field in top right
- Hero image of library in background

**Option C:**
- Logo, search, and navigation grouped in one floating box
- Other images and text for books further down page

**Option D:**
- Simplified navigation
- Discover, about, and donate areas as parts of actual homepage

**Option E:**
- "Outside the box" approach
- Search super prominent (search engine style)

## Selection process

After creating multiple wireframes, identify features you like most by marking them with a star.
Once you've identified the best parts, combine them into one new wireframe.

## Takeaways

1. **Exploration is critical** - Create multiple versions to find the best solution
2. **Follow industry standards** - Use consistent visual conventions for clarity
3. **Plan before drawing** - List required elements upfront
4. **Think systematically** - Work through page sections logically (header → content → footer)
5. **Above the fold matters** - Place important content where users see it immediately
6. **Iterate and refine** - Identify best elements from multiple versions
7. **Be creative** - Don't be afraid to try unconventional layouts
8. **Combine strengths** - Final wireframe can merge best parts from all variations
9. **Wireframes are only blueprints** - They're meant to be rough, fast, and iterative. The goal is exploring ideas, not creating polished designs at this stage.
