## What is information architecture (IA)?

Information architecture (IA) organizes content to help users understand where they are in a product and where the information they want is. It serves as the roadmap for users to navigate and find everything they need from your website.

## Why information architecture matters?

Good information architecture creates clear navigation and shows how all website parts connect. It helps stakeholders review content and engineers understand how to build the site correctly. IA saves development time by preventing messy mistakes and allows designers to improve their ideas at different project stages.

## Key foundation for IA

Effective information architecture should be informed by:

- **User research** - understanding user goals, behaviors, and expectations
- **Competitive audits** - examining how existing products are structured
- **User knowledge** - deep understanding of who you're designing for
