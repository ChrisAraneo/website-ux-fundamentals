# Iterate on mockups based on feedback from crit sessions

After receiving feedback from a design critique session, it's time to turn that feedback into concrete improvements to your designs. This involves evaluating the feedback, creating action items, and making practical changes to your mockups in your design tool.

## Creating action items from feedback

After reviewing notes from a design critique session, you need to decide which suggestions to incorporate and generate specific action items. Here are common types of actions you might take:

1. **Create additional screens** - address user flow gaps or alternative scenarios that reviewers identified.

2. **Ensure design consistency** - check that elements like buttons have the same heights, widths, and placement across all screens.

3. **Iterate on specific elements** - refine individual design components based on reviewer suggestions.

4. **Verify accessibility standards** - check that colors, contrast, and other elements meet accessibility requirements.

5. **Consult with other team members** - reach out to product managers, developers, or other stakeholders when feedback has cross-functional implications.

## Example: Iterating on dog walker app mockups

Here's how specific feedback from a design critique session can be translated into concrete design improvements:

### Action 1: Create more screens for single dog owners

When a reviewer asks about the user experience for users with only one dog, create alternative versions of screens to show this user flow. For example, on the book appointments screen, instead of showing three dog names where users must select at least one, show only one dog name that's automatically selected. This saves the user time and addresses different user scenarios.

### Action 2: Ensure button consistency

Perform a detailed check of every button in the user flow to make sure they're the same heights and widths. If you find inconsistencies, make quick adjustments to standardize all buttons across the design.

### Action 3: Review button placement

Check that all related buttons (like "Next" buttons) are positioned at the same x and y-axis coordinates on the grid across all screens. In Figma, you can click on a button and check the right-side panel to see where it's positioned on the screen. For example, a "Next" button should have consistent x and y values (such as x value of 16 and y value of 8) to indicate that the button is in the same place across screens.

### Action 4: Iterate on icon designs

When reviewers suggest that icons look busy, do several rounds of iteration to address this feedback. Some feedback can take time to implement, but that's part of the process. For example, if three icons across the top of the screen were each surrounded by a circle with accompanying text labels beneath them, you might remove the circles and text labels so the icons stand alone. This creates a cleaner and less busy design.

### Action 5: Check color accessibility

Use tools like WebAIM (Web Accessibility in Mind) to check the contrast between two colors and compare them against WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards. If your original color doesn't pass accessibility standards, choose a darker or lighter shade that passes AAA accessibility. For example, if using orange buttons, you might change from a lighter shade to a darker shade with hex value D53E0B.

When updating colors across multiple elements, you can save time by selecting all buttons and icons at once (hold and drag your cursor) and changing the color in the right-side panel under "Selection colors." Update the color in your sticker sheet as well to save time in the future.

## Types of feedback to prioritize

Not all feedback requires the same level of action. Here's how to evaluate and prioritize feedback:

### High priority feedback

Take immediate action on feedback related to:
- **Design functionality** - issues that affect how the design works for users.
- **Accessibility** - problems that prevent some users from accessing or using the design.
- **Design inconsistencies** - elements that don't follow established patterns or standards.
- **User experience impact** - feedback that addresses how the design affects the overall user experience.

### Lower priority feedback

Consider but don't necessarily act on feedback that:
- **Lacks supporting reasoning** - opinions not connected to design principles or user needs.
- **Focuses on personal preferences** - stylistic choices based on individual taste rather than user research or design standards.
- **Offers solutions instead of identifying problems** - suggestions that don't explain what's wrong with the current design.

### Feedback requiring collaboration

Some feedback requires input from other team members before taking action:
- **Cross-functional implications** - changes that affect development, product strategy, or business operations.
- **Feature additions or changes** - suggestions that go beyond design and require product manager approval.
- **Technical feasibility** - ideas that need developer input to determine if they're practical to implement.

## Synthesizing feedback from multiple reviewers

When you have multiple reviewers in a large design critique session, you'll need to synthesize feedback and identify themes, similar to synthesizing participant feedback from usability studies. With only a few reviewers, there's less synthesis needed, but you should still look for patterns in their comments.

Start by reviewing the notes and asking yourself: "How can I synthesize the feedback from the design critique session?" and "What feedback do I want to take action on to improve my designs or the user experience?"

## Key principles for acting on feedback

When deciding how to respond to feedback, keep these principles in mind:

- **You don't have to incorporate every suggestion** - you are in charge of your designs, so you don't have to implement all feedback. Just be prepared to explain your choices.

- **Consider your reasoning for rejecting feedback** - ask yourself whether you're rejecting feedback because you're attached to the current version of the design or because your idea is actually a better fit for the user.

- **Focus on user-centered feedback** - prioritize feedback that's aimed at creating better experiences for users over feedback based on personal preferences.

- **Ask clarifying questions** - if feedback is unclear, reach out to reviewers for clarification before taking action.

- **Some changes take time** - don't expect to implement all feedback immediately. Some iterations require multiple rounds of refinement.

## Benefits of design critique sessions

Design critique sessions offer several advantages for UX designers and teams:

- **Sharpen design skills** - regular practice with critiques helps you become more comfortable with the process of receiving and giving feedback.

- **Build team relationships** - gathering together to exchange ideas encourages collaboration and builds rapport across teams.

- **Broaden perspective** - reviewers from different backgrounds and skill sets can identify opportunities for improvement that you might have missed.

- **Develop critical eye** - participating in critiques helps you learn to spot issues in your own work and develop better design judgment.

- **Continue iteration** - feedback helps you understand if your design is moving in the right direction or if you need to change direction in small or big ways.

The more practice you have with design critiques, the more comfortable you'll be with the process of receiving critiques on your own designs and offering your opinion about someone else's designs.

## Key terms and definitions

Understanding key terminology helps you participate effectively in design critique sessions:

- **Design critique session** - a planned period of time where UX designers present their work to team members and listen to feedback.

- **Facilitator** - runs the critique session and guides the process, keeps track of time, creates agenda and goals, and ensures everyone gets to share their ideas.

- **Presenter** - the designer who is sharing their work with others in the session (could also be a group of designers who worked together).

- **Reviewer** - gives feedback about the design and offers clear actions to take. There are often multiple reviewers in a session.

- **Notetaker** - captures all of the ideas and feedback from the reviewers so conversations can flow without interruption.

- **Feedback** - asking for or receiving ideas about what is or isn't working in a design.

- **WCAG** - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, standards for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities.

- **WebAIM** - Web Accessibility in Mind, a tool that allows you to check the contrast between two colors and compare them against WCAG standards.

## Working with developers

After design critique sessions, you may need to collaborate with developers to implement your designs:

- **Front-end developer** - writes code for all the user-facing interface based on UX designer specifications.

- **Back-end developer** - writes code for the website's architecture and data storage or retrieval based on the UX sitemap and functionality.

These collaborations ensure that your design improvements can be successfully implemented in the final product.

## Creating case studies from your work

As you complete design projects and iterate based on feedback, document your work in case studies. A case study is a summarized presentation of a design project that typically includes:

- **Project goal and objectives** - what you were trying to achieve.
- **Your role on the project** - what responsibilities you had.
- **Process your team followed** - how you approached the design challenge.
- **Outcome of the project** - what results you achieved.

Case studies help you showcase your design process and demonstrate how you respond to feedback and iterate on your designs.
