## Give and receive feedback as a UX designer

### Why feedback matters

Feedback means asking for or receiving ideas about what is or isn't working in your designs. Good feedback helps generate new questions or ideas that you might not have thought about before, which helps you find ways to improve your work.

As a UX designer, it's important to reflect on how much feedback you're giving and receiving at each stage of a project. Ask yourself: "Am I comfortable sharing my opinions about another designer's project? Am I checking in regularly with team members to get feedback on my designs?"

### Benefits of regular design feedback

Asking for design feedback regularly offers several advantages:

1. **Improves your designs and skills** - teammates can offer ideas or suggestions that you might not have considered before, and continual feedback helps build your confidence as you recognize improvement over time.

2. **Builds confidence and expertise** - the more feedback you get, the more you will improve your skills and recognize your growth as a designer.

3. **Broadens your perspective** - working with people from different backgrounds and skill sets helps identify opportunities for improvement that you may have missed.

Receiving feedback from a diverse audience is essential because our personal biases inform what we create. New perspectives can help mitigate bias in your design and offer additional ways to solve challenges. It can also help you consider experiences unique to users other than those you initially imagined.

### How to give effective feedback

Giving feedback can be difficult, but it's a critical part of the design iteration process. Here are key principles for giving great feedback:

1. **Adjust feedback for each situation** - consider the role of the person you're giving feedback to (engineer, project manager, or fellow designer) and their experience level (junior or senior).

2. **Provide reasoning to support your feedback** - explain why something isn't working rather than just stating your opinion. For example, instead of saying "I don't like the color you chose," say "I don't like the color you chose, because it's not accessible." This provides actionable improvement rather than broad criticism.

3. **Describe problems, not solutions** - focus on identifying issues with the design rather than telling the designer how to fix them. This gives the designer an opportunity to process your feedback and come up with their own solutions to the problems.

### Learning to embrace feedback

Receiving design critiques can feel uncomfortable at first, especially when you feel defensive about your work. However, with practice, time, and reflection, you'll start to value critiques and understand that you don't always have to follow all the feedback or advice. Most importantly, you'll become more confident in your own design decisions. Asking for feedback early in the process and as often as possible helps you learn from colleagues and improve your work over time.

## The basics of design critique sessions

### What is a design critique session?

A design critique session is a planned period of time where UX designers present their work to team members and listen to feedback. These sessions are also a great opportunity to practice giving feedback to other team members. Design critiques are a chance for many people to come together to exchange ideas and make a collective choice on a design direction, whether in person or remotely.

When planned with clear objectives and good preparation, design critique sessions can be very useful and can improve the ways you and your team work together in the future.

### Roles in a design critique session

Participants in a design critique can play one of three main roles (sometimes four):

1. **Facilitator** - runs the crit session and guides the process, monitors the time, ensures objectives are being followed, makes sure everyone's voice is included, and ensures there is enough time for all ideas to be shared. Not every design critique needs a facilitator.

2. **Presenter** - the designer who is sharing their work with others in the session. The presenter needs to prepare beforehand, be actively engaged, and be ready to ask questions for clarification after feedback is given.

3. **Reviewer (or critic)** - gives feedback about the design and offers clear actions to take. There is usually more than one reviewer in a design critique.

4. **Notetaker (optional)** - captures all of the ideas and feedback from the reviewers so that the presenter can stay fully present and focused.

### Structure of a design critique session

While there's not one right way to run a design critique, here is one common structure:

1. **Facilitator provides overview** - defines the objectives of the design critique session, which should be specific and time-bound (for example, getting initial feedback on mockups for the booking process in a dog walker app).

2. **Presenter shares design work** - as they present their designs, reviewers begin to jot down their feedback in the form of questions, ideas, likes, or challenges.

3. **Reviewers take turns explaining feedback** - the facilitator lets reviewers share their thoughts while the presenter can ask clarifying questions and thoughtfully respond to the feedback.

4. **Facilitator wraps up the session** - asks any questions tied to the objectives that may not have already been covered.

## Best practices for design critique sessions

### Preparing as the presenter

As the presenter, preparation is key. You're responsible for creating a brief presentation to share with everyone attending the crit session. The most important part of this presentation is the design itself.

When preparing your presentation, be ready to discuss the thinking behind any of your design decisions. Focus on these five questions:

1. **Who are you designing for?** - identify your target users and their needs.

2. **What problem are you trying to solve?** - clearly articulate the user problem your design addresses.

3. **How are your designs solving or not solving these problems?** - explain your design decisions and their intended impact.

4. **Where in the design process are you?** - provide context about whether this is early exploration or nearly final work.

5. **What aspects of your designs are you seeking feedback on?** - help reviewers focus on the specific areas where you need input.

Thinking critically about these questions will help you remember the most important aspects of your design to focus on when presenting, and will help reviewers stay focused on the areas where you need feedback.

### Managing presentation complexity

Provide reviewers with enough information to get meaningful feedback, while keeping in mind the session length and whether reviewers will have enough time to understand your designs. If you have a complex prototype, you may want to send it to reviewers in advance of the session.

### During the critique session

Follow these best practices when presenting:

1. **Take in the feedback and decide if you want to ask for clarification or respond** - you'll also have time after the session to think about how and when to take action based on the feedback you received.

2. **Focus on active listening** - it's not easy to hear comments about things you're not doing right, and you might become defensive or want to give an explanation. Instead, focus on listening and asking questions to help better understand the reviewer's point of view.

3. **Be ready to take action on feedback after the session** - in most design critique sessions, there can be multiple reviewers and multiple parts of your design being critiqued, so be prepared to receive lots of comments. After you have a chance to think about all the feedback you've received, you can decide if your design will stay the course or change direction.

Think of your work as a boat, and you're the captain. In a design critique session, the feedback helps you understand if the boat is moving in the right direction, or if you need to change direction in small or big ways.

### Value of regular critique sessions

Regular feedback is a key part of every designer's process. Design critique sessions help you identify different perspectives to consider design problems from, learn new skills, and develop your own critical eye for design. Feedback helps improve both your work and your personal skills over time.
