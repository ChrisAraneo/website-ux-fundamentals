## What is responsive design?

Responsive web design allows a website to automatically adapt its appearance based on the device's screen size. This involves more than just resizing-elements may change position and organization to optimize the user experience across different devices.

## Why responsive design matters?

**User Statistics (2019)**:
- 74% of US adults own a desktop or laptop computer
- 81% of US adults own a smartphone
- Users expect consistent functionality across all devices

**Market Demand**:
- 185+ million active websites on the internet (2019)
- New websites created every second
- High demand for multi-device compatible designs

**UX Designer Job Market**:
- 90% of UX designers work on websites or web-based applications
- 76% work on mobile apps
- Responsive web design skills make portfolios more attractive to employers

## Native mobile apps & responsive web apps

### Dedicated mobile apps

**Native mobile app** is an app downloaded to device, accessed via home screen icon.

**Advantages**:
- Works offline after download/installation
- Integrates with device features (camera, microphone, location services)
- More design freedom (gestures, animations)
- Enhanced personalization options

**Disadvantages**:
- More expensive to build
- Requires separate versions for iOS and Android
- Must go through app store approval process
- Takes up device storage space
- Challenging for devices with limited storage

### Responsive Web Apps

**Responsive web app** is a website accessed through mobile browser and it adapts to device.

**Advantages**:
- Faster and cheaper to build
- No download required-saves device storage
- Accessible without app store
- Content viewable on all devices
- Saves time, resources, and money

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires internet connection or cell signal (no offline access)
- Harder for users to discover (not in app stores)
- Challenging to maintain across all screen sizes
- May be difficult to access for users in remote areas

### Summary

Both approaches have their place in UX design. Understanding the trade-offs helps designers choose the right solution based on user needs, project constraints, and business goals.

# Information architecture

![Information architecture](/information-architecture.png)

## What is information architecture (IA)?

Information architecture (IA) organizes content to help users understand where they are in a product and where the information they want is. It serves as the roadmap for users to navigate and find everything they need from your website.

Information architecture is fundamentally about organizing content for excellent user flow. To create effective IA, designers must thoroughly understand their users' goals, behaviors, and expectations.

## Key Foundation for IA

Effective information architecture should be informed by:

- **User research** - Understanding user goals, behaviors, and expectations
- **Competitive audits** - Examining how existing products are structured
- **User knowledge** - Deep understanding of who you're designing for

## Why information architecture matters?

### 1. **Organizes and defines website structure**
- Creates easy navigation for users
- Establishes clear organizational patterns

### 2. **Provides high-level product view**
- Shows how website elements fit together
- Clarifies relationships between different parts
- Improves overall design process

### 3. **Facilitates stakeholder review**
- Enables stakeholders to evaluate content appropriateness
- Helps assess if content placement aligns with business goals
- Supports product goal achievement

### 4. **Supports engineering development**
- Helps engineers understand data organization
- Ensures development matches visual designs
- Makes colleagues' jobs easier

### 5. **Saves development time**
- Prevents messy architecture that delays web development
- Reduces costly mistakes and rework

### 6. **Enables design iteration**
- Allows ideas to grow and evolve
- Supports adaptation at different project stages
- Key skill for UX designers

# Common website structures

![Common website structures](/common-website-structures.png)

## Common website structures

### 1. **Hierarchical model** (most popular)
- **Structure**: Top-down approach with parent and child levels, similar to a family tree
- **Components**:
  - Homepage at the top
  - Parent pages (main categories) in navigation bar
  - Child pages (subcategories) under each parent
- **Example**: HBO.com with main categories (Series, Movies, Docs) and subcategories (Featured Series, Specials, Sports)
- **Key concept**: Organizes content by importance-what's most/least important and how content connects

### 2. **Sequential model**
- **Structure**: Leads users through step-by-step linear process
- **Navigation**: Users move from starting page to endpoint in order
- **Limitations**: Cannot skip pages or navigate out of order in true sequential structures
- **Example**: Car insurance quote forms, online surveys
- **Purpose**: Move users toward an end goal through sequential steps

### 3. **Matrix model** (Web Model)
- **Structure**: Content linked in multiple ways, allowing users to follow their own path
- **Navigation**: Users can access any page while still reaching all other pages
- **Features**: Free exploration with interconnected content
- **Example**: News websites with navigation menus, featured content, and hyperlinked related articles
- **Caution**: Considered outdated by some UX designers; can be difficult to navigate without clear direction
- **Use Case**: Websites wanting users to interact with lots of content rather than following a specific journey

### 4. **Database model**
- **Structure**: Combines organized information database with search functionality
- **Features**: Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- **Dynamic Experience**: Content categorized with tags for easy searching
- **Examples**: Social media networks (location tags), Google Maps (searchable addresses and categories)

## Advantages of using common website structures

Common website structures help users browse more efficiently by providing familiar information architecture patterns. Understanding the four common website structures is essential for organizing content effectively and building information architecture that meets user needs.

- **Meets User Expectations**: Users have prior experience with these structures across different websites
- **Improves Navigation**: Adds organization and logical cues to orient and direct users
- **Proven Effectiveness**: Tested over time and evolved based on user and designer feedback
- **Efficient Development**: Saves time by providing starting frameworks rather than building from scratch

## Choosing the right structure

- Depends on website and user needs
- Most websites use **combinations** of multiple structures
- Flexibility to blend structures for specific project requirements
- Can go beyond these models for unique brand requirements
- **Critical**: Users must be able to easily and effectively navigate the website

## Sitemaps

### Sitemap

A **sitemap** is a diagram showing how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled in a website or app.

Sitemaps are essential tools for planning website architecture and ensuring all users can successfully navigate the design. Clear organizational structure through sitemaps is essential for user navigation and successful website design. Sitemaps serve as foundational planning tools for web architecture.

### Benefits of using sitemaps

1. **Clear organizational path**: Helps visualize site structure in early planning stages
2. **Identifies connectivity needs**: Shows which areas require elaborate connections
3. **Comprehensive overview**: See all pages in the order they appear to users
4. **Catch mistakes early**: Spot forgotten pages or opportunities to condense content
5. **Search engine indexing**: Helps Google and other search engines understand site content
6. **Accessibility**: Creates organized flow for all users, especially those using assistive technology

### Sitemap Structure (hierarchical example)

- **Top rectangle**: Homepage (user entry point)
- **Row of rectangles below**: Main categories connected to homepage
- **Columns below categories**: Subcategories for each main category

## Building a sitemap

### Step 1: Identify common pages
- Think about standard website pages (homepage, product pages, shopping cart, etc.)
- Review competitive audit findings
- Note common pages from competitor websites
- Example: Library websites typically have search results pages

### Step 2: Recall user research
- Reference empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps
- Focus on user problems and goals
- Map user journey to sitemap structure
- Example: Shane's journey-browse books → choose book → reserve → waitlist → pick up

### Step 3: Choose website structure
- Select from: hierarchical, sequential, matrix, or database
- Can use combination of structures
- Example: Library website uses hierarchical structure (homepage with connected pages)
- **Pro Tip**: Use templates based on common structures to jumpstart process

### Step 4: Start with homepage
- Homepage is the access point and first user experience
- Place at top of sitemap diagram

### Step 5: Define main categories
- Add to row of rectangles connected to homepage
- These appear in navigation bar on actual website
- Example for library website: Books, Checkout Cart, User Account, About
- Note: Number of categories varies by project needs

### Step 6: Add subcategories (child pages)
- Fill rectangles below each main category
- Example for Books category: Recent Releases, Most Popular, Recommendations
- Continue for all main categories

## Example sitemap

[Example of a visual sitemap for a website that sells coffee products](https://api.backlinko.com/app/uploads/2025/05/sitemap-1280x1054.webp)

## Sitemap types by website size

- **Flat sitemaps**: Small websites (under 100 pages) with maximum 4 vertical levels
- **Deep sitemaps**: Large websites (1,000+ pages) with 5 or more vertical levels
