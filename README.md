## What is responsive design?

Responsive web design allows a website to automatically adapt its appearance based on the device's screen size. This involves more than just resizing—elements may change position and organization to optimize the user experience across different devices.

## Why responsive design matters?

**User Statistics (2019)**:
- 74% of US adults own a desktop or laptop computer
- 81% of US adults own a smartphone
- Users expect consistent functionality across all devices

**Market Demand**:
- 185+ million active websites on the internet (2019)
- New websites created every second
- High demand for multi-device compatible designs

**UX Designer Job Market**:
- 90% of UX designers work on websites or web-based applications
- 76% work on mobile apps
- Responsive web design skills make portfolios more attractive to employers

## Native mobile apps & responsive web apps

### Dedicated mobile apps

**Native mobile app** is an app downloaded to device, accessed via home screen icon.

**Advantages**:
- Works offline after download/installation
- Integrates with device features (camera, microphone, location services)
- More design freedom (gestures, animations)
- Enhanced personalization options

**Disadvantages**:
- More expensive to build
- Requires separate versions for iOS and Android
- Must go through app store approval process
- Takes up device storage space
- Challenging for devices with limited storage

### Responsive Web Apps

**Responsive web app** is a website accessed through mobile browser and it adapts to device.

**Advantages**:
- Faster and cheaper to build
- No download required—saves device storage
- Accessible without app store
- Content viewable on all devices
- Saves time, resources, and money

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires internet connection or cell signal (no offline access)
- Harder for users to discover (not in app stores)
- Challenging to maintain across all screen sizes
- May be difficult to access for users in remote areas

### Summary

Both approaches have their place in UX design. Understanding the trade-offs helps designers choose the right solution based on user needs, project constraints, and business goals.

# Information architecture

## What is information architecture (IA)?

Information architecture (IA) organizes content to help users understand where they are in a product and where the information they want is. It serves as the roadmap for users to navigate and find everything they need from your website.

Information architecture is fundamentally about organizing content for excellent user flow. To create effective IA, designers must thoroughly understand their users' goals, behaviors, and expectations.

## Key Foundation for IA

Effective information architecture should be informed by:

- **User research** - Understanding user goals, behaviors, and expectations
- **Competitive audits** - Examining how existing products are structured
- **User knowledge** - Deep understanding of who you're designing for

## Why information architecture matters?

### 1. **Organizes and defines website structure**
- Creates easy navigation for users
- Establishes clear organizational patterns

### 2. **Provides high-level product view**
- Shows how website elements fit together
- Clarifies relationships between different parts
- Improves overall design process

### 3. **Facilitates stakeholder review**
- Enables stakeholders to evaluate content appropriateness
- Helps assess if content placement aligns with business goals
- Supports product goal achievement

### 4. **Supports engineering development**
- Helps engineers understand data organization
- Ensures development matches visual designs
- Makes colleagues' jobs easier

### 5. **Saves development time**
- Prevents messy architecture that delays web development
- Reduces costly mistakes and rework

### 6. **Enables design iteration**
- Allows ideas to grow and evolve
- Supports adaptation at different project stages
- Key skill for UX designers

## Common website structures

Understanding the four common website structures is essential for organizing content effectively and building information architecture that meets user needs.
