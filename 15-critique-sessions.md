# Critique Sessions

## Feedback

### Why feedback matters?

Feedback means asking for or receiving ideas about what is or isn't working in your designs. **Good feedback helps generate new questions or ideas that you might not have thought about before**, which helps you find ways to improve your work.

As a UX designer, it's important to reflect on how much feedback you're giving and receiving at each stage of a project. Ask yourself: "Am I comfortable sharing my opinions about another designer's project? Am I checking in regularly with team members to get feedback on my designs?"

### Benefits of design feedback

Asking for design feedback regularly offers several advantages:

1. **Improves your designs and skills** - teammates can offer ideas or suggestions that you might not have considered before, and continual feedback helps build your confidence as you recognize improvement over time.
2. **Builds confidence and expertise** - the more feedback you get, the more you will improve your skills and recognize your growth as a designer.
3. **Broadens your perspective** - working with people from different backgrounds and skill sets helps identify opportunities for improvement that you may have missed.

Receiving feedback from a diverse audience is essential because our personal biases inform what we create. New perspectives can help mitigate bias in your design and offer additional ways to solve challenges. It can also help you consider experiences unique to users other than those you initially imagined.

### How to give effective feedback?

1. **Adjust feedback for each situation** - consider the role of the person you're giving feedback to (engineer, project manager, or fellow designer) and their experience level (junior or senior).
2. **Provide reasoning to support your feedback** - explain why something isn't working rather than just stating your opinion. For example, instead of saying "I don't like the color you chose," say "I don't like the color you chose, because it's not accessible." This provides actionable improvement rather than broad criticism.
3. **Describe problems, not solutions** - focus on identifying issues with the design rather than telling the designer how to fix them. This gives the designer an opportunity to process your feedback and come up with their own solutions to the problems.

### Embrace feedback

Receiving design critiques can feel uncomfortable at first, especially when you feel defensive about your work. However, with practice, time, and reflection, you'll start to **value critiques and understand that you don't always have to follow all the feedback or advice**. Most importantly, you'll become more confident in your own design decisions. Asking for feedback early in the process and as often as possible helps you learn from colleagues and improve your work over time.

## Design critique sessions

### What is a design critique session?

A design critique session is a **planned period of time where UX designers present their work to team members and listen to feedback**. These sessions are also a great opportunity to practice giving feedback to other team members. Design critiques are a chance for many people to come together to exchange ideas and make a collective choice on a design direction, whether in person or remotely.

When planned with clear objectives and good preparation, design critique sessions can be very useful and can improve the ways you and your team work together in the future.

### No distinction between entry-level and senior

In a critique session there's not really a distinction between being entry-level or senior. At some point everyone is going to have work that they want to put in front of their peers for feedback, so you're going to be expected to play the same roles as a presenter or as a reviewer. Just be thoughtful about how you're presenting and how you're giving feedback.

### Roles in a design critique session

1. **Facilitator** - runs the crit session and guides the process, monitors the time, ensures objectives are being followed, makes sure everyone's voice is included, and ensures there is enough time for all ideas to be shared. Not every design critique needs a facilitator.
2. **Presenter** - the designer who is sharing their work with others in the session. The presenter needs to prepare beforehand, be actively engaged, and be ready to ask questions for clarification after feedback is given.
3. **Reviewer (or critic)** - gives feedback about the design and offers clear actions to take. There is usually more than one reviewer in a design critique.
4. **Notetaker (optional)** - captures all of the ideas and feedback from the reviewers so that the presenter can stay fully present and focused.

### Structure of a design critique session

1. **Facilitator provides overview** - defines the objectives of the design critique session, which should be specific and time-bound (for example, getting initial feedback on mockups for the booking process in a dog walker app).
2. **Presenter shares design work** - as they present their designs, reviewers begin to jot down their feedback in the form of questions, ideas, likes, or challenges.
3. **Reviewers take turns explaining feedback** - the facilitator lets reviewers share their thoughts while the presenter can ask clarifying questions and thoughtfully respond to the feedback.
4. **Facilitator wraps up the session** - asks any questions tied to the objectives that may not have already been covered.

### Preparing as the presenter

As the presenter, preparation is key. You're responsible for creating a brief presentation to share with everyone attending the crit session. The most important part of this presentation is the design itself.

When preparing your presentation, be ready to discuss the thinking behind any of your design decisions. Focus on these five questions:

1. **Who are you designing for?** - identify your target users and their needs.
2. **What problem are you trying to solve?** - clearly articulate the user problem your design addresses.
3. **How are your designs solving or not solving these problems?** - explain your design decisions and their intended impact.
4. **Where in the design process are you?** - provide context about whether this is early exploration or nearly final work.
5. **What aspects of your designs are you seeking feedback on?** - help reviewers focus on the specific areas where you need input.

Thinking critically about these questions will help you remember the most important aspects of your design to focus on when presenting, and will help reviewers stay focused on the areas where you need feedback.

### Managing presentation complexity

Provide reviewers with enough information to get meaningful feedback, while keeping in mind the session length and whether reviewers will have enough time to understand your designs. If you have a complex prototype, you may want to send it to reviewers in advance of the session.

### Tips for presenting

As a presenter, one of the hardest things to do in a critique is keep people focused on the specific things you want feedback on. Oftentimes, people will want to start reviewing other parts of the designs or other parts of the product. It's easy for discussions to go off the rails. As much as possible, try to keep the discussion focused on the task at hand.

### During the critique session

1. **Take in the feedback and decide if you want to ask for clarification or respond** - you'll also have time after the session to think about how and when to take action based on the feedback you received.
2. **Focus on active listening** - it's not easy to hear comments about things you're not doing right, and you might become defensive or want to give an explanation. Instead, focus on listening and asking questions to help better understand the reviewer's point of view.
3. **Be ready to take action on feedback after the session** - in most design critique sessions, there can be multiple reviewers and multiple parts of your design being critiqued, so be prepared to receive lots of comments. After you have a chance to think about all the feedback you've received, you can decide if your design will stay the course or change direction.

Think of your work as a boat, and you're the captain. In a design critique session, the feedback helps you understand if the boat is moving in the right direction, or if you need to change direction in small or big ways.

### Value of critique sessions

Regular feedback is a key part of every designer's process. **Design critique sessions help you identify different perspectives to consider design problems from, learn new skills, and develop your own critical eye for design**. Feedback helps improve both your work and your personal skills over time.

### How to receive feedback effectively?

- **Actively listen to every comment** - don't interrupt reviewers or offer explanations unless asked to do so. Instead, focus on asking questions about their feedback to grasp their perspectives.
- **Use a notetaker for longer sessions** - plan to have someone capture all of the feedback, especially if you know it will be a longer session. Knowing you'll have notes to review later will allow you to focus on the discussion.
- **Review notes before refining designs** - once you're ready to refine your designs based on the session's feedback, review any notes and pointers so you don't miss any of them.
- **Make thoughtful decisions about feedback** - you are in charge of your designs, so you don't have to incorporate every suggestion you receive. Just be prepared to explain your choices once you share your designs with your team again. Consider whether you're rejecting others' feedback because you're attached to the current version of the design or because your idea is actually a better fit for the user.

### Tips for reviewing

When reviewing someone else's work, before giving feedback, always make sure you have a way to connect it to some broader point. Provide the right framing for your feedback, so you're not leaving someone with just your subjective opinion. Even if you have a subjective opinion, attach it to something that they can find useful to anchor to.

### What to observe in a critique session?

When watching a critique session, pay attention to how the presenter responds to feedback:

- **Is the presenter actively listening?** - observe whether they're engaged and focused on understanding the feedback.
- **Is the presenter taking notes?** - notice if they're capturing important points for later review.
- **What types of follow-up questions is the presenter asking?** - look at how they seek clarification and deeper understanding.

Also focus on the way that reviewers share their feedback and opinions:

- **Do the reviewers share the reasoning behind their feedback?** - check if they explain why something works or doesn't work.
- **Do the reviewers focus on problems with the design instead of offering solutions?** - see if they describe issues and let the designer come up with solutions.
- **Do the reviewers connect their feedback to the objectives of the design critique session?** - observe whether feedback stays aligned with the session goals.

### Example critique focus areas

In a typical critique session for a design project like a dog walker app, the presenter might ask for feedback on specific elements such as the scheduling flow and call-to-action buttons. Remember, call-to-action buttons are elements in the design that tell the user to take action. In the dog walker app, the call-to-action buttons might be labeled things like "book appointment" and "next."

### Processing feedback

Start by reviewing the notes that you or a notetaker took during the critique session. As you review the notes, take some time to really think about the feedback you received. Ask yourself: "How can I synthesize the feedback from the design critique session?" and "What feedback do I want to take action on to improve my designs or the user experience?"

When you have only a few reviewers, there's less synthesis needed. However, if you have multiple reviewers in a large design critique session, you will probably need to synthesize that feedback and identify themes, similar to synthesizing participant feedback from usability studies.

As you review feedback, you might think of follow-up questions for reviewers to clarify their suggestions. Don't hesitate to reach out for clarification before taking action. This ensures you understand the intent behind the feedback and can make informed decisions about your design iterations.

Over time, you'll gain more and more confidence with the process of receiving and giving feedback. You'll also develop more strategies about how to take useful feedback and generate action items to keep improving your design. The key is to approach feedback as an opportunity for growth rather than criticism, and to be thoughtful about which suggestions to implement based on user needs, design principles, and practical constraints.

### Best practices for acting on feedback

When deciding how to respond to feedback, keep these principles in mind:

- **You don't have to incorporate every suggestion** - you are in charge of your designs, so you don't have to implement all feedback. Just be prepared to explain your choices.
- **Consider your reasoning for rejecting feedback** - ask yourself whether you're rejecting feedback because you're attached to the current version of the design or because your idea is actually a better fit for the user.
- **Focus on user-centered feedback** - prioritize feedback that's aimed at creating better experiences for users over feedback based on personal preferences.
- **Ask clarifying questions** - if feedback is unclear, reach out to reviewers for clarification before taking action.
- **Some changes take time** - don't expect to implement all feedback immediately. Some iterations require multiple rounds of refinement.

### Creating action items

Here's how to evaluate each piece of feedback and determine appropriate actions:

1. **Evaluate the impact and reasoning** - when feedback isn't supported by specific design principles and doesn't explain how changes would impact the user experience or functionality, it might be a "nice to have" suggestion rather than a "must fix" issue.
2. **Identify cross-functional implications** - some feedback impacts more than just the design and requires input from other team members. 
3. **Address user-centered concerns** - feedback that's user-centered and aimed at creating options for possible solutions should be prioritized. 
4. **Check design consistency** - when reviewers point out inconsistencies, verify your designs against specifications.
5. **Iterate on specific elements** - when reviewers suggest simplifications or changes to specific design elements, plan to spend time iterating. 
6. **Verify accessibility standards** - accessibility feedback is critical and must be addressed.

### High priority feedback

Take immediate action on feedback related to:

- **Design functionality** - issues that affect how the design works for users.
- **Accessibility** - problems that prevent some users from accessing or using the design.
- **Design inconsistencies** - elements that don't follow established patterns or standards.
- **User experience impact** - feedback that addresses how the design affects the overall user experience.

### Lower priority feedback

Consider but don't necessarily act on feedback that:

- **Lacks supporting reasoning** - opinions not connected to design principles or user needs.
- **Focuses on personal preferences** - stylistic choices based on individual taste rather than user research or design standards.
- **Offers solutions instead of identifying problems** - suggestions that don't explain what's wrong with the current design.

### Feedback requiring collaboration

Some feedback requires input from other team members before taking action:

- **Cross-functional implications** - changes that affect development, product strategy, or business operations.
- **Feature additions or changes** - suggestions that go beyond design and require product manager approval.
- **Technical feasibility** - ideas that need developer input to determine if they're practical to implement.

### Iterate on mockups based on feedback

After receiving feedback from a design critique session, it's time to turn that feedback into concrete improvements to your designs. This involves evaluating the feedback, creating action items, and making practical changes to your mockups in your design tool.

### Working with developers

After design critique sessions, you may need to collaborate with developers to implement your designs:

- **Front-end developer** - writes code for all the user-facing interface based on UX designer specifications.
- **Back-end developer** - writes code for the website's architecture and data storage or retrieval based on the UX sitemap and functionality.

These collaborations ensure that your design improvements can be successfully implemented in the final product.

### Creating case studies from your work

As you complete design projects and iterate based on feedback, document your work in case studies. A case study is a summarized presentation of a design project that typically includes:

- **Project goal and objectives** - what you were trying to achieve.
- **Your role on the project** - what responsibilities you had.
- **Process your team followed** - how you approached the design challenge.
- **Outcome of the project** - what results you achieved.

Case studies help you showcase your design process and demonstrate how you respond to feedback and iterate on your designs.
