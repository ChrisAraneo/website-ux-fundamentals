# Wireframes

## What is wireframe?

A **wireframe** is an outline or sketch of a product/screen consisting of shapes, lines and minimal text.
Wireframes help designers figure out the layout of the page. They act like blueprints for site structure.

## Wireframing conventions

- **Text** is represented by horizontal lines
- **Icons/Images** are represented by squares with X overlay
- **Call-to-action buttons (CTA)** are rectangles or circles
- **Placeholders** are represented by shapes or lines holding space for future visual elements

## Above the fold

**Above the fold** is content on webpage that doesn't require scrolling to experience.

## Lorem Ipsum

**Lorem Ipsum** is placeholder text used in design to fill space where real content will eventually go. Lorem ipsum allows designers to visualize text-heavy areas without being distracted by actual content meaning.

## Icon placeholders

Icon placeholders are visual markers used in wireframes to indicate where icons will appear in the final design. They help designers plan layout and spacing for functional icons without committing to specific icon designs during the wireframing phase.

## Paper and digital wireframes

Many UX designers start with paper wireframes and later switch to digital to balance speed of exploration with refinement.

### Paper wireframing

- Start sketching on paper
- Allows working through many iterations faster
- Easy to throw away wireframes that aren't working
- Typical starting point for many UX designers

### Grid paper

- Helps maintain proportions
- Assists with alignment
- Provides consistent scaling
- Makes comparison easier across versions

### Digital wireframing

- Create wireframes using digital tools
- Switch to digital after paper exploration

## Responsive design wireframes

Implement layout changes based on device/screen size to improve user experience and accessibility across devices. Best practice is to create at least 5 versions of every important page.

### Design strategy: largest to smallest

- Assume the desktop homepage wireframe is the **largest screen** to design for
- Create progressively smaller versions by asking:
  - "What would a medium version look like?"
  - "What would a small version look like?"
  - "Which components will be **removed**?"
  - "Which will **stay**?"
  - "Which will **shift position** or **change format**?"

### Mobile wireframe

- Draw smaller, portrait-oriented outline (narrower than desktop)
- Use grid lines as placement guide
- Scale desktop elements down (~1/3 size for mobile)
- May span multiple A5 pages when sketching

### Tablet wireframe

- Draw outline larger than mobile, smaller than desktop
- Still portrait-oriented
- Scale elements proportionally using grid

## Usability, accessibility and visual clutter

When adapting for responsive layouts, verify:

- **Did I think about usability** when designing for smaller screen sizes?
- **Did I consider accessibility** when designing for new screen sizes?
- **Did I try to reduce clutter** and save space when designing for new screen sizes?

### Design considerations for smaller screens

- **Remove** non-essential UI components
- **Maintain** critical elements
- **Shift** positions or change formats
- **Space-saving elements** - hamburger menus, cards, carousels
- **Reduce clutter** - prioritize usability and accessibility

## Sketching paper wireframes

### Preparation

1. **List required information** - document all elements needed on page (navigation, images, text descriptions)
2. **Reference sitemap** - use sitemap to determine page structure and element prioritization
3. **Gather materials** - grid paper (or template), pen/pencil

### Drawing process

1. **Create multiple variations** - sketch 4-5 different layout versionss. Each version should have different design solutions.
2. **Consider all device types** - sketch wireframes for each device type and screen size.
3. **Top-to-bottom approach** - it is recommended to use *top-to-bottom* design approach. That is how users experience webpage.

### Review and refinement

1. **Identify best elements** - Mark favorite features from each wireframe
2. **Combine marked elements** - Create final wireframe integrating best components
3. **Repeat for all pages** - Apply same process to remaining website pages

### Documentation

1. **Note design decisions** - note reasoning behind breakpoint decisions, element positions on different devices
2. **Document wireframe progression for portfolio**
3. **Document takeaways** - write down what you have learned

## Best practices

1. **Focus on structure, not aesthetics** - detailed design comes later
2. **Iteration is essential** - designs evolve throughout the process
3. **Grid paper benefits** - enables consistent scaling and element proportion
4. **Industry standards** - facilitate team communication and understanding
5. **Progressive refinement** - paper sketches → digital wireframes
6. **Use standard visual conventions** - improves communication with team members
7. **Always reference sitemap** - ensures all required elements are included

## Transition to digital versions

After completing paper wireframes for all screen sizes, transition to digital wireframing tools to refine designs and prepare for prototyping. At this point placeholders should be filled with images or components.

### Applying layout grid in Figma

1. **Select Frame**
   - Click on frame where layout grid is needed
   - Ensure correct frame is active

2. **Access Layout Grid Section**
   - Right-hand sidebar
   - Find **Layout Grid** section
   - Click **"+" button** to create new grid

3. **Open Grid Panel**
   - Click **grid icon** to left of new grid
   - Opens detailed grid settings panel

4. **Change View to Columns**
   - Use drop-down menu
   - Change from **Grid** to **Columns**
   - This creates columnar structure

5. **Adjust Grid Properties**
   - Enter **count** of columns
   - Choose **color** for visibility
   - Adjust other properties:
     * Type
     * Width
     * Gutter size
   - Customize according to design requirements

6. **Finalize Settings**
   - Close panel when complete
   - Or click outside grid settings panel
   - Grid now active on frame

### Tips

- Upload paper wireframe photos to Figma for constant reference
- Set up grid system once, then duplicate frame for other pages
- Create reusable components for repeated elements (navigation, footer)
- Use keyboard shortcuts
- Use same placeholder conventions across all pages
- Keep visual hierarchy consistent
- Apply same fold principles to every page
