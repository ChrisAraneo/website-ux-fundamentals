## What is responsive design?

Responsive web design allows a website to automatically adapt its appearance based on the device's screen size. This involves more than just resizing-elements. Components may change position and organization to optimize the user experience across different devices.

## Why responsive design matters?

Responsive web design is important because most people use multiple devices (74% have computers, 81% have smartphones) and expect websites to work well on all of them. Since the vast majority of UX designers (90%) focus on web-based projects, mastering responsive design is crucial for professional growth in the industry. It also saves time and money because you only need to build one website that works on every device instead of making separate versions for each screen size.

## Native mobile apps & responsive web apps

Both approaches have their place in UX design. Understanding the trade-offs helps designers choose the right solution based on user needs, project constraints, and business goals.

### Native mobile apps

**Native mobile app** is an app downloaded to device, accessed via home screen icon.

**Advantages**:
- Works offline after download/installation
- Integrates with device features (camera, microphone, location services)
- More design freedom (gestures, animations)
- Enhanced personalization options

**Disadvantages**:
- More expensive to build
- Requires separate versions for iOS and Android
- Must go through app store approval process
- Takes up device storage space
- Challenging for devices with limited storage

### Responsive web apps

**Responsive web app** is a website accessed through mobile browser and it adapts to device.

**Advantages**:
- Faster and cheaper to build
- No download required-saves device storage
- Accessible without app store
- Content viewable on all devices
- Saves time, resources, and money

**Disadvantages**:
- Requires internet connection or cell signal (no offline access)
- Harder for users to discover (not in app stores)
- Challenging to maintain across all screen sizes
- May be difficult to access for users in remote areas

## Responsive design mistakes

- Buttons that can't be seen
- Graphics that go off the side of the screen
- Content cut off or inaccessible
- Poor usability on certain devices

Example of bad UX is an image showing content extending beyond screen boundaries, causing usability issues.

## Breakpoints

**Breakpoints** are visual limits that determine when a responsive layout should change to fit all elements and components properly.

Live example:
- Adjust shape of browser window on computer to vertical rectangle
- Website will eventually **shift to mobile version** of site
- Transition happens automatically at breakpoint
- Triggered by code behind the website

With breakpoints you **don't** have to create a different design for every potential device and screen size. You design for a **few key sizes**.

## Common mobile screen sizes

Common screen sizes include iPhone 14 Pro (393px × 852px), iPhone 14 Pro Max (430px × 932px), Android Large (360px × 800px), and Android Small (360px × 640px).

**Pro tip:** Start with a common size like 375px × 667px (iPhone SE) or 360px × 800px (Android). You can adjust later for specific devices.

## Above the fold

**Above the fold** is content on webpage that doesn't require scrolling to experience.

## Critical design questions

When designing across different screen sizes, consider:

1. **Element location**
   - Do elements on the page need to move location?
   - Which parts need to stay **above the fold** on smaller screens?
   - Which can move **below the fold**?
2. **Image scaling**
   - How do images need to be scaled?
   - Are there certain images (like **hero images**) that need to remain large across all screen sizes?
   - What's the minimum acceptable size for each image type?
3. **Navigation adjustments**
   - How will navigation elements adjust as screen size changes?
   - Example: Moving from **top navigation bar** to **hamburger menu**
   - What interactive elements need to change format?
