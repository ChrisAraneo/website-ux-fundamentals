# Mockups

## Mockup

**Mockup** is a static, high-fidelity design that represents the final product. Think of it as a detailed visual representation of your product that:

- Shows more detail than wireframes
- Requires less work than full interactive prototypes
- Helps refine layouts, colors, and user interfaces
- Serves as a bridge between wireframes and prototypes

## Mockups vs wireframes

Wireframes are simple sketches or outlines that show the basic structure and layout of a screen or product. You can draw them on paper or create them digitally, but they don't include colors or detailed design elements.

Mockups are more polished versions that look closer to the final product. They include colors, fonts, and icons to show what the design will actually look like, but you can't click or interact with them yet.

| Wireframes | Mockups |
|------------|---------|
| Static images | Static high-fidelity designs |
| Show page layout & hierarchy | Show visual details & UI elements |
| No color or detail | Include color, typography, iconography |
| Outline content structure | Represent near-final appearance |
| Blueprint phase | Visual refinement phase |

## Transition to mockups

Creating mockups from wireframes isn't just about copying what you already have. You should make improvements and changes to ensure the design looks good, works well for users, and is accessible to everyone. Like wireframes, you'll create multiple versions of your mockups, getting feedback each time and continuously improving them until they're ready.
