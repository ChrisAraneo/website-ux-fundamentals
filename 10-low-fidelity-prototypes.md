# Low-fidelity prototypes

## What are prototypes?

UX prototypes are interactive models of a product used to test ideas before building the final version. Prototypes help designers gather user feedback and identify problems early in the design process.

## Low-fidelity vs. High-fidelity prototypes

Low-fidelity prototypes (lo-fi prototypes) are simple, basic structures that communicate big-picture design concepts and test navigation flow, while high-fidelity prototypes (hi-fi prototypes) are polished designs with full functionality that closely match the final product.

## Low-fidelity prototypes vs. wireframes

While both are simple versions with minimal content, they serve different purposes:

- **Wireframes** - blueprints of product structure only
- **Lo-fi prototypes** - connect wireframes together with functionality and navigation

## When to build low-fidelity prototypes

Build them after you've designed wireframes and you want to test if users can successfully navigate the designs to complete tasks.

## Purpose of testing

Testing prototypes helps:
- Identify and solve problems related to website function
- Test how the website works with real people
- Gather user feedback before investing in high-fidelity designs

## Workflow

Wireframes → Low-fi prototypes → Testing → High-fi prototypes → Testing → Final Product

## User flows

User flows are the paths users take through a product to complete specific tasks. User flows help designers plan navigation and ensure users can successfully accomplish their goals.

A prototype is always built around testing the user flow that solves the user problem.

Before building, ask yourself:
1. How will users navigate through the necessary pages?
2. How will users go from one page to the next?

A good user flow should allow users to:
- **Move forwards and backwards** through the prototype
- **Enter from different starting points**
- **Clearly understand** when the flow has ended
- **Return to the entry point** after completing the interaction

## Example: checkout flow for buying t-shirts

1. Navigate to the women's section
2. Choose a t-shirt
3. Select the color and size
4. Add it to the cart
5. Continue to checkout
6. Fill in e-mail address
7. Choose a shipping option
8. Enter payment and billing information
9. Click "Place order"

## Entry points

Entry points are starting locations where users begin their interaction with the website.

Key questions to consider when defining entry points:
- What do I want my user to be able to do?
- How will my users navigate through the website structure?
- Where do I want them to start their journey?

## Prototyping in Figma

Prototype mode:
1. Open your digital wireframe project
2. Go to the right sidebar
3. Click the **Prototype** tab to create user interaction flows between pages

Connecting frames:
1. Click the first item in the user flow
2. A blue circular node appears on the right side
3. Click and drag the blue arrow to the destination item on another frame
4. Release the mouse to complete the connection

Creating user flow:
- Work carefully following your intended user flow as a guide
- Create all necessary interactions using the same connection process
- **Preview your work**: Click the **Play** icon to test
- Test all buttons and connections to ensure they work correctly
- Connect all wireframes necessary for the main user flow

## Quality checklist

When evaluating your own low-fidelity prototype, ask yourself:
1. **Structure & flow** - does it connect **at least four distinct wireframes**? Does it allow completion of a **main user flow**?
2. **Navigation** - can users move **forward and backward**? Are there **clear navigation cues**? Are there **multiple entry points**?
3. ** Completion & feedback** - are there **messaging or navigational cues** that indicate successful completion? Can users **return to the starting point** after completing the flow sequence?
