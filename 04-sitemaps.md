## Sitemap

A **sitemap** is a diagram showing how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled in a website or app.

Sitemaps are essential tools for planning website architecture and ensuring all users can successfully navigate the design. Clear organizational structure through sitemaps is essential for user navigation and successful website design. Sitemaps serve as foundational planning tools for web architecture.

## Benefits of using sitemaps

1. **Clear organizational path** - helps visualize site structure in early planning stages
2. **Identifies connectivity needs** - shows which areas require elaborate connections
3. **Comprehensive overview** - see all pages in the order they appear to users
4. **Catch mistakes early** - spot forgotten pages or opportunities to condense content
5. **Search engine indexing** - helps Google and other search engines understand site content
6. **Accessibility** - creates organized flow for all users, especially those using assistive technology

## Sitemap structure

- **Top rectangle** - homepage (user entry point)
- **Row of rectangles below** - main categories connected to homepage
- **Columns below categories** - subcategories for each main category

## Building a sitemap

### Step 1: Identify common pages
- Think about standard website pages (homepage, product pages, shopping cart, etc.)
- Review competitive audit findings
- Note common pages from competitor websites
- Example: Library websites typically have search results pages

### Step 2: Recall user research
- Reference empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps
- Focus on user problems and goals
- Map user journey to sitemap structure
- Example: Shane's journey-browse books → choose book → reserve → waitlist → pick up

### Step 3: Choose website structure
- Select from: hierarchical, sequential, matrix, or database
- Can use combination of structures
- Example: Library website uses hierarchical structure (homepage with connected pages)
- **Pro Tip** - use templates based on common structures to jumpstart process

### Step 4: Start with homepage
- Homepage is the access point and first user experience
- Place at top of sitemap diagram

### Step 5: Define main categories
- Add to row of rectangles connected to homepage
- These appear in navigation bar on actual website
- Example for library website: Books, Checkout Cart, User Account, About
- Note: Number of categories varies by project needs

### Step 6: Add subcategories (child pages)
- Fill rectangles below each main category
- Example for Books category: Recent Releases, Most Popular, Recommendations
- Continue for all main categories

## Sitemap types by website size

- **Flat sitemaps** - small websites (under 100 pages) with maximum 4 vertical levels
- **Deep sitemaps** - large websites (1,000+ pages) with 5 or more vertical levels
