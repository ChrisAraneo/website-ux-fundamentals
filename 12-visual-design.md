# Visual design

## What is visual design?

**Visual design** refers to how a product or technology appears to the user.

The three main elements of visual design are typography (text and fonts), color, and iconography (icons and symbols). These elements work together to make designs look good, help users navigate easily, communicate information clearly, and keep the brand looking consistent.

## Typography

**Typography** is the practice of arranging text and typefaces (fonts) to make language legible, readable, and visually appealing.

- Adds hierarchy to designs
- Makes text easy to read
- Adds visual style

## Color

**Color** is one of the most impactful visual design elements.

- How color communicates messages and emotions?
- How people understand color?
- How colors mix, match, or contrast?

- **Red:** Attracts attention
- **Blue:** Communicates serenity, calmness, and peace

## Iconography

**Iconography** are images or symbols associated with a subject or idea. For example Power icon = circle with a line (⏻)

- Icons limits used text space
- Icons and symbols catch the user's attention
- They provide easy transitions to other pages or locations

## Layouts

Beyond typography, color, and iconography, successful designs require careful consideration of **layouts** and how elements are arranged on a page. Great layouts present information in a logical way, making important elements standout.

There are three key tools for effective layouts:
- Grids
- Containment
- Negative space

## Grids

Lines that are evenly spaced to help you design consistently and manage the spacing of elements.

**Layout grid:**
- Vertical columns with spaces (alleys) between them
- Common for responsive web design
- Helps align elements consistently

**Uniform Grid:**
- Intersecting vertical and horizontal lines
- Creates a matrix of evenly spaced guidelines
- Called "Uniform Grids" in Figma

## Containment

Visual barriers that keep designs neat and organized.

There are four methods for containment: dividers, borders, fill, shadows.

### Method 1: Dividers

**Dividers** are single lines to separate sections of a page.

- Separating list items
- Dividing content sections
- Creating visual breaks between information

*Example:* Horizontal lines separating messages in an inbox.

### Method 2: Borders

**Borders** are continuous lines forming shapes (squares, rectangles) to break up sections.

- Highlighting selections
- Grouping related content
- Creating distinct content areas
- Showing interactive states

*Example:* Borders around size options (pink borders for unselected, black for selected).

### Method 3: Fill

Shapes should have colors inside.

- Creating prominent call-to-action buttons
- Distinguishing different element states
- Adding visual emphasis
- Creating depth and hierarchy

#### Method 4: Shadows

**Shadows** are creating dimension in combination with borders or fill.

**Key characteristics:**
- Add depth to designs
- Signal interactivity (e.g., selected items)
- Shadow depth can change element perspective
- Vary from subtle (2px) to dramatic (24px)

**Use Case:**
- Indicating selected items
- Creating card-style layouts
- Showing elevated elements
- Adding realistic depth

## Negative space

**Negative space** is the area that surrounds an object within an image; the gaps between elements or space not being used.

**Improves readability:**
- Helps users read content more easily
- Reduces visual clutter
- Prevents information overload

**Enhances identification:**
- Makes important information stand out
- Guides user attention
- Creates visual hierarchy

**Visual appeal:**
- Makes content easier to engage with
- Creates a cleaner, more professional look
- Provides visual rest areas

| Less negative space | More negative space |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Crowded elements | Spacious layout |
| Harder to read | Easier to read |
| Overwhelming | Calm and organized |
| Less engaging | More visually appealing |

## Emphasis

**Emphasis** is about making **the most important parts of your design stand out** so users notice them first. You can do this by making key elements larger, brighter, or more prominent than other elements. This helps guide users to the most important content or actions they need to take.

## Hierarchy

Hierarchy is about **organizing your design so users can easily see what's most important**. You do this by making important elements bigger and brighter, while less important elements are smaller and less noticeable. This creates a clear order that helps users understand what to look at first and guides them through the content naturally.

## Scale

Scale is about **changing the size of elements to show how important they are** and create visual contrast. By making some elements bigger and others smaller, you can draw attention to specific parts of your design. Even when you change the size, the elements should still be easy to recognize.

## Proportion

Proportion is about **keeping consistent size relationships between elements** in your design. When you change the size of elements, they should maintain the same ratio to each other, which creates a balanced and harmonious look. This ensures that all parts of your design feel like they belong together and look visually pleasing.

## Unity

Unity is about **making all parts of your design feel connected and like they belong together**. You achieve this by grouping related elements together and using consistent colors, styles, and patterns throughout your design. This creates a cohesive look that feels like one complete design rather than separate pieces, and helps strengthen the brand's identity.

## Variety

The variety principle involves **introducing different shapes or patterns with the same size and color to make designs more interesting**. It helps stop designs from looking boring and keeps users interested. The trick is to add enough variety to be interesting, but not so much that the design looks chaotic or confusing.

# Design systems

## What is a design system?

Design system is a series of reusable elements and guidelines that allow teams to design and develop a product following predetermined standards. Think of it as a comprehensive toolkit and rulebook for creating consistent designs across all products and platforms.

## Benefits of using design system

- **Consistency** ensures designers work in a standardized way while users get familiar, predictable experiences that reinforce brand identity.
- **Scalability** makes it easy to expand designs to new products and platforms while maintaining consistency.
- **Efficiency** saves time and money by eliminating the need to redesign common elements and enabling faster prototyping.
- **Collaboration** improves by creating a common language between designers and developers, making it easier to onboard new team members and communicate design decisions clearly.

## Components of a design system

Design systems have four main components that work together to create consistent products.

1. **Visual styles** - include typography, color palettes with HEX codes, and iconography to express the brand consistently across all touchpoints. 
2. **Guidelines** - provide design principles and rules that help designers make consistent decisions about when and how to use components.
3. **UI components** - are ready-to-use interface elements like buttons, cards, and forms that maintain consistency and speed up the design process.
4. **Supporting code for developers** - gives developers the technical specifications and code snippets they need to build the designs correctly and bridge the gap between design and development.

## Sticker sheets

Sticker sheet is a frame within Figma where you **save colors and components that you can copy-and-paste into designs**. Sticker sheet is your design toolkit - a centralized collection of all reusable design elements that ensures consistency, saves time, and facilitates collaboration. 

What to include in a sticket sheet?
- Components
- Typography
- Color
- Iconography

- Sticker sheets are **essential** for maintaining consistency
- Larger companies have **comprehensive design systems** built on this concept
- **Time saved** using sticker sheets = more time for creative problem-solving
- Sticker sheets are often **shared across teams** for collaboration
- They serve as **living documentation** of design decisions

## Popular big company design systems

- Google Material Design
- Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- Microsoft Fluent Design System

## UI kits

UI kit is a **collection of elements, components, and files** that help UX designers create apps and websites.

Figma Community has numerous UI kits available for download.

What's included
- Pre-designed components (buttons, cards, forms)
- Typography sets
- Icon libraries
- Color palettes
- Layout templates

**Key difference:** UI kits are like simplified design systems - they include design components you don't need to create yourself.
